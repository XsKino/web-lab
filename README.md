# Kino's Web Lab

Welcome to Kino's Web Lab, a collection of creative front-end showcases. Dive into a world where code meets imagination, and each project is a testament to the journey of honing coding skills and embracing creativity.

## About the Challenge
[50 Projects 50 Days](https://50projects50days.com/) is a coding adventure where you take on the challenge of building 50 diverse web projects, although it actually took me (way) more than 50 days. This repository serves as a showcase of my endeavors, each project highlighting different aspects of web development, design, and functionality.

I intend to make this website a place to showcase some cool capabilities of the web platform, and to inspire others to do the same, specially people who are just starting out.

## Explore the Projects
Feel free to explore the various projects within this repository. From interactive web interfaces to dynamic components, each project comes with its own set of challenges and unique solutions.

## Project Highlights
Here are a few standout projects that showcase the range of skills developed during this challenge:

- [Project 2: Progress steps](./src/pages/test/2) - Here I took on the challenge of working with svg paths, combining it with React's user interactivity to make a very creative progress steps indicator.
